"""Cohen's kappa calibration harness for the LLM-as-judge scorer.

Usage
-----
Run via the CLI entry-point::

    uv run voice-eval calibrate --labels evals/calibration.csv

Or call the functions directly for testing / embedding in other scripts.

The kappa value computed from the bundled stub ``evals/calibration.csv``
is MEANINGLESS — those rows contain placeholder human labels.  Replace
them with real human annotations before trusting the kappa output.  See
``evals/CALIBRATION.md`` (written after each run) for the interpretation.

Cohen's kappa formula
---------------------
Given N judgement pairs (human_score, llm_score) where each score is
binary (0 or 1):

    p_o  = observed agreement fraction = (TP + TN) / N
    p_e  = expected agreement by chance
         = p_human_1 * p_llm_1 + p_human_0 * p_llm_0
    kappa = (p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)

where p_human_1 = fraction of human labels == 1, etc.

Kappa interpretation (Landis & Koch 1977):
    < 0       : less than chance agreement
    0.00-0.20 : slight
    0.21-0.40 : fair
    0.41-0.60 : moderate
    0.61-0.80 : substantial
    0.81-1.00 : almost perfect
